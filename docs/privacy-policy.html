            <p>
                <span class="bold">Firebase Cloud Services:</span> Your data is stored securely in Google
                Firebase Cloud Firestore with industry-standard encryption at rest and in transit.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Security Measures:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>End-to-end encryption for sensitive data</li>
                <li>Secure authentication via Firebase Auth</li>
                <li>Automatic session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity</li>
                <li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
