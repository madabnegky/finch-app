## Key Findings Summary

### Web App Status: FEATURE COMPLETE
- **7 screens** fully implemented
- **12 modals** for all operations
- **20+ UI components** in component library
- **2 charts** (pie and line)
- **Full CRUD** on all data types
- **Server-side projections** (365-day forecasts)
- **Advanced features**: Recurring transactions, goal allocation, budgeting, "What If?" simulation

### Mobile App Status: IN EARLY STAGE
- **4 screens** (only 1 with real features: Dashboard)
- **2 components** (AddTransactionModal, AccountSetupGate)
- **Basic dashboard** showing accounts and last 10 transactions
- **No advanced features**
- **No navigation beyond stacking**
- **No charting**
- **Limited data operations** (read-only for most data)

### Critical Gaps (Most Important to Implement)
1. **Recurring Transaction Management** - Complex, affects many screens
2. **Transaction History & Filtering** - Core functionality missing
3. **Analytics & Reports** - No visualization at all
4. **Budget Tracking** - Category-based budgeting completely missing
5. **Goal/Envelope System** - Savings goals not implemented
