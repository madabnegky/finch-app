# Finch Android App - Production Readiness Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all security and production-readiness improvements made to prepare the Finch Android app for real user testing.

**Date**: January 2025
**App Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Ready for Private Alpha Testing

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Improvements

### 1. Production Keystore & App Signing

**Files Modified**:
- `/packages/mobile/android/app/finch-release.keystore` (created)
- `/packages/mobile/android/keystore.properties` (created)
- `/packages/mobile/android/app/build.gradle`
- `/packages/mobile/.gitignore`

**What Was Done**:
- Generated production keystore using PKCS12 format with 2048-bit RSA key
- Configured release build signing in Gradle
- Stored keystore credentials securely in `keystore.properties` (not committed to Git)
- Added fallback to debug keystore for development builds

**Keystore Details**:
- **Alias**: `finch-release-key`
- **Password**: `FinchSecure2025!` (BACKUP THIS!)
- **Validity**: 10,000 days (until March 9, 2053)
- **SHA-256 Fingerprint**: `9A:15:D5:E4:2F:CB:EF:0E:DA:D0:B7:9A:FE:CD:F8:F8:CD:FB:53:29:50:19:D9:11:D3:D0:A3:EB:C0:3F:46:5C`

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Backup the keystore file and password immediately. If lost, you cannot update the app on Google Play Store.

### 2. ProGuard/R8 Code Obfuscation

**Files Modified**:
- `/packages/mobile/android/app/build.gradle`
- `/packages/mobile/android/app/proguard-rules.pro`

**What Was Done**:
- Enabled ProGuard/R8 for release builds (`enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true`)
- Enabled resource shrinking to reduce APK size
- Created comprehensive ProGuard rules for:
  - React Native core
  - Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Messaging, Crashlytics)
  - Google Sign-In
  - Plaid Link SDK
  - OkHttp, Gson, React Native libraries
  - Source map preservation for crash debugging

**Benefits**:
- Code is now obfuscated and harder to reverse-engineer
- APK/AAB size reduced through resource shrinking
- Production app is more secure against tampering

---

### 3. Firebase Crashlytics

**Files Modified**:
- `/packages/mobile/package.json`
- `/packages/mobile/android/build.gradle`
- `/packages/mobile/android/app/build.gradle`

**What Was Done**:
- Installed `@react-native-firebase/crashlytics` (v23.4.1)
- Added Crashlytics Gradle plugin (v3.0.2)
- Initialized Crashlytics in App.tsx with automatic crash reporting
- Set app version attribute for debugging

**Benefits**:
- Automatic crash reporting to Firebase Console
- Stack traces for debugging production crashes
- Performance monitoring capability

---

### 4. Session Timeout Security

**Files Created**:
- `/packages/mobile/src/hooks/useSessionTimeout.ts`

**Files Modified**:
- `/packages/mobile/App.tsx`

**What Was Done**:

---

### 5. Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

**Files Created**:
- `/packages/mobile/src/legal/PrivacyPolicy.tsx`
- `/packages/mobile/src/legal/TermsOfService.tsx`

**Files Modified**:

**What Was Done**:
- Created comprehensive Privacy Policy covering:
  - Data collection (personal, financial, usage)
  - How data is used
  - Third-party services (Plaid, Firebase)
  - User rights (access, deletion, export)
  - GDPR compliance
  - Data retention policies

- Created comprehensive Terms of Service covering:

**What Was Done**:
- Implemented comprehensive account deletion that removes:
  - All transactions
  - All budgets and goals
  - All bank account connections
  - All notification tokens
  - All categories and preferences
  - User profile document
  - Firebase Auth account

- Added double confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- Handles re-authentication requirements
- Provides clear error messages

**Benefits**:
- GDPR "right to be forgotten" compliance
- User data privacy
- Required for Google Play Store
- Builds user trust

---

## üìã Manual Steps Required

### 1. Add SHA-256 Fingerprint to Firebase Console

**Why**: Google Sign-In and other Firebase features require the production SHA-256 fingerprint.

**Steps**:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Your App
2. Under "SHA certificate fingerprints", click "Add fingerprint"
3. Add this SHA-256: `9A:15:D5:E4:2F:CB:EF:0E:DA:D0:B7:9A:FE:CD:F8:F8:CD:FB:53:29:50:19:D9:11:D3:D0:A3:EB:C0:3F:46:5C`
4. Download the updated `google-services.json`
5. Replace the file in `/packages/mobile/android/app/google-services.json`

### 2. Update Google Cloud Console OAuth Credentials

**Why**: Google Sign-In on production builds requires the production SHA-256.

**Steps**:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID for Android
3. Add the SHA-256 fingerprint above
4. Save changes

### 3. Backup Keystore and Password

**Critical**: Store these securely in multiple locations:
- Password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.)
- Encrypted cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Offline backup (USB drive in safe)

**What to backup**:
- File: `/packages/mobile/android/app/finch-release.keystore`
- Password: `FinchSecure2025!`
- Alias: `finch-release-key`
- SHA-256 fingerprint (above)

### 4. Enable Crashlytics in Firebase Console

**Steps**:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Crashlytics
2. Enable Crashlytics for your app
3. Build and run a release build to verify it's working
4. (Optional) Force a test crash to confirm reporting

## üöÄ Building for Production

### Build Release APK (for testing)
```bash
cd packages/mobile/android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
Output: `/packages/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Build Release AAB (for Google Play Store)
```bash
cd packages/mobile/android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```
Output: `/packages/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Verify Signing
```bash
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs /path/to/app-release.apk
```
