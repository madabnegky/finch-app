# Smart Transaction Notifications - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### **Smart Context-Aware Transaction Notifications**
Real-time notifications with available-to-spend balance context, intelligent queuing for overnight transactions, and batched morning summaries.

---

## üéØ Key Features

### **1. Active Hours Notification (7:30 AM - 10 PM)**
- Immediate notifications during active hours
- Context-aware messages based on available-to-spend balance
- Critical alerts for low balances (< $100)
- Warning alerts for getting low (< $250)
- Paycheck notifications with updated available balance

### **2. Smart Queuing (10 PM - 7:30 AM)**
- Transactions outside active hours are queued
- Sent as batched morning summary at 7:30 AM local time
- Intelligently summarizes overnight activity
- Shows updated available-to-spend balance
- Includes upcoming bills if balance is low

### **3. Available-to-Spend Context**
- Every notification includes current available-to-spend balance
- Shows upcoming bills (next 7 days) when balance is low
- Helps users understand financial health, not just transactions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**

**`packages/functions/index.js`**

1. **Helper Functions** (Lines 29-114)
   - `isInActiveHours(userTimezone)` - Check if 7:30 AM - 10 PM
   - `getNext730AM(userTimezone)` - Calculate next morning delivery
   - `formatCurrency(amount)` - Format for notifications

2. **Notification Functions** (Lines 1190-1444)
   - `sendImmediateTransactionNotification()` - Send during active hours
   - `sendBatchedMorningNotification()` - Send queued overnight summary

3. **processSyncTask Integration** (Lines 1658-1701)
   - Added notification logic after creating new transactions
   - Checks if in active hours ‚Üí send immediately or queue
   - Only notifies on POSTED transactions (not pending)
   - Graceful error handling (doesn't fail sync if notification fails)

4. **Scheduled Function** (Lines 1739-1805)
   - `sendQueuedNotifications` - Runs every 15 minutes
   - Checks for pending notifications scheduled for now or earlier
   - Groups by user and sends batched summary
   - Marks as processed to prevent duplicates

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

### **Firestore Collections:**

**`users/{uid}`**
```javascript
{
  timezone: 'America/New_York',  // User's local timezone
  fcmTokens: ['token1', 'token2'], // Device tokens (existing)
}
```

**`users/{uid}/pendingNotifications` (NEW)**
```javascript
{
  transactionId: "txn_123",
  accountId: "acc_456",
  accountName: "Chase Checking",
  merchantName: "Shell Gas",
  amount: -45.00,
  type: "expense",
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  scheduledFor: Timestamp,  // 7:30 AM next morning
  userTimezone: "America/New_York",
  processed: false,
  processedAt: Timestamp  // Added when sent
}
```

## ‚è∞ Notification Schedule

| Time | Transaction | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 11:30 PM | Gas $45 | ‚úÖ Queued for 7:30 AM |
| 2:15 AM | Car Payment $387 | ‚úÖ Queued for 7:30 AM |
| 6:45 AM | Chipotle $18.47 | ‚úÖ Queued for 7:30 AM |
| **7:30 AM** | - | üì± "3 transactions... Available: $2,397" |
| 9:15 AM | Starbucks $5.75 | üì± Immediate notification |
| 3:45 PM | Whole Foods $87 | üì± Immediate notification |
| 8:30 PM | Dinner $42 | üì± Immediate notification |
| 11:45 PM | Late snack $12 | ‚úÖ Queued for tomorrow 7:30 AM |

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### **1. Deploy Cloud Functions**

```bash
cd packages/functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Functions Deployed:**
- `sendQueuedNotifications` (new scheduled function)
- `processSyncTask` (updated with notification logic)
- All existing functions unchanged

### **2. Create Firestore Index (Required)**

The `sendQueuedNotifications` function uses a compound query:

```bash
firebase firestore:indexes
```

Add index for `pendingNotifications`:
```
Collection Group: pendingNotifications
Fields:
  - processed (Ascending)
  - scheduledFor (Ascending)
```

Or let Firebase auto-create it when you first run the function (Firebase will provide a link in the logs).

## üß™ Testing

### **Test 1: Immediate Notification (Daytime)**

1. **Time**: During active hours (9 AM)
2. **Action**: Trigger a Plaid sync with new transaction
3. **Expected**: Immediate notification with available balance

```bash
# Trigger webhook manually or wait for real transaction
# Check Firebase Functions logs:
firebase functions:log --only processSyncTask
```

### **Test 2: Queued Notification (Overnight)**

1. **Time**: Outside active hours (11 PM)
2. **Action**: Trigger a Plaid sync with new transaction
3. **Expected**:
   - Transaction saved to Firestore
   - Notification queued in `pendingNotifications`
   - No immediate notification sent

```bash
# Check pending notifications:
# In Firestore console: users/{uid}/pendingNotifications
```

### **Test 3: Morning Batch (7:30 AM)**

1. **Time**: 7:30 AM (scheduled function runs every 15 min)
2. **Expected**:
   - Batched summary sent
   - All pending notifications marked as processed

```bash
# Check scheduled function logs:
firebase functions:log --only sendQueuedNotifications
```

### **Test 4: Paycheck Detection**

1. **Action**: Add a positive transaction (income)
2. **Expected**: "üí∞ Paycheck deposited ‚Ä¢ Available: $4,236 ‚úì"

### **Test 5: Low Balance Alert**

1. **Setup**: Account with < $100 available
2. **Action**: Trigger transaction sync
3. **Expected**: "üî¥ LOW BALANCE ALERT" with upcoming bills

---

## üìä Monitoring

### **Cloud Functions Logs:**

```bash
# View all notification logs
firebase functions:log | grep notification

# View immediate notifications
firebase functions:log --only processSyncTask | grep "immediate notification"

# View queued notifications
firebase functions:log --only processSyncTask | grep "Queuing notification"

# View batched morning summaries
firebase functions:log --only sendQueuedNotifications
```

### **Firestore Monitoring:**

Check these collections:
- `users/{uid}/pendingNotifications` - Should be empty after 7:30 AM
- `users/{uid}/transactions` - Verify new transactions
- `users/{uid}` - Check `fcmTokens` and `timezone`

---

## üí° Key Design Decisions

1. **Why 7:30 AM?**
   - Most people wake up between 7-8 AM
   - Gives financial overview before day starts
   - Not too early to disturb sleep

2. **Why 10 PM cutoff?**
   - Respects evening wind-down time
   - Prevents notification anxiety before bed
   - Batches late-night transactions naturally

3. **Why only posted transactions?**
   - Pending transactions can change/cancel
   - Reduces notification spam
   - More accurate balance information

4. **Why show available-to-spend?**
   - Context > raw transaction amount
   - Helps users make spending decisions
   - Reduces financial anxiety

5. **Why batch overnight transactions?**
   - Prevents 3 AM notification wake-ups
   - Cleaner morning summary
   - Better UX than individual overnight alerts

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Notifications not sending**

**Check:**
1. User has FCM tokens registered
2. User timezone is set (defaults to America/New_York)
3. Transaction is POSTED (not pending)
4. Cloud Function deployed successfully

**Debug:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only processSyncTask
# Look for: "Sending immediate notification" or "Queuing notification"
```

### **Issue: Morning notifications not arriving**

**Check:**
1. `sendQueuedNotifications` function is deployed
2. Firestore index exists for compound query
3. Pending notifications exist and `scheduledFor` is in past

**Debug:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only sendQueuedNotifications
# Should run every 15 minutes
```

### **Issue: Wrong timezone**

**Fix:**
Add `timezone` field to user document:
```javascript
await db.collection('users').doc(userId).set({
  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'  // Or user's actual timezone
}, { merge: true });
```

6:46 PM  üì± "‚ö†Ô∏è Chase Checking ‚Ä¢ Whole Foods ‚Ä¢ $127 ‚Ä¢ Available: $212 (Getting low)"
         User realizes they're getting low on funds

9:00 PM  Checks app, decides to skip dinner out
         Avoids overspending thanks to notification awareness

11:30 PM üí≥ Late night gas station run
         No notification - queued for tomorrow morning

Next Day:
7:30 AM  üì± "üåÖ Good morning! 1 transaction while you were away..."
```
